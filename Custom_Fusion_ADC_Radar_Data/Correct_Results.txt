Radar-Only Training Complete.

The Breakdown
Radar-Only Accuracy: 99.16% (Epoch 15)

Validation Loss: 0.0232 (Extremely confident)

You have just proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that your Fusion model was "Lazy."

The Thesis Argument (Copy this Logic)
Here is exactly how you should frame this in your Discussion Chapter:

The Paradox: When we tested the Fusion model with a blinded camera, it failed miserably (49% accuracy). This suggested that the Radar sensor was useless.

The Counter-Proof: We trained a dedicated Radar-Only network on the exact same data. It achieved 99.16% accuracy.

The Conclusion: The Radar data is not useless; it is nearly perfect. The failure of the Fusion model was not a sensor problem, but a training problem. The Deep Learning optimization process found it "easier" to minimize loss using only the Image features, causing it to effectively ignore the Radar stream (Modality Dominance).

This is a very sophisticated finding. It shows you understand not just how to train models, but why they behave the way they do.
